# [üíª KayanoShy's Terminal Website](https://www.kayano.fun)

This is my personal terminal-styled website built with LiveTerm and Next.js. It's a customized version of the original [LiveTerm](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm) project.

## üîÑ Customizations & Improvements

### UI/UX Changes
- **Minimalist Initial View**: The website now starts with just a command prompt, without displaying personal information upfront
- **English Content**: All content has been translated to English for better accessibility
- **Improved Command Structure**: Commands have been reorganized for better user experience
- **Custom Banner**: Updated the ASCII banner with my personal branding

### Content Changes
- **Personal Information**: Updated with my education, skills, and project experience
- **Resume Command**: Added a detailed resume that displays directly in the terminal
- **GitHub Integration**: Modified to link to my GitHub repositories

### Technical Changes
- **Removed Sumfetch**: Simplified the codebase by removing the sumfetch component
- **Enhanced Help Command**: Improved the help command with better categorization
- **Direct Information Display**: Information is now displayed directly in the terminal instead of opening external links
